Using DocWriter
===============


| First have a look at :class:`DocWriter<docme.builders.writer.DocWriter>` class.
| You can use this class instead of calling the cli command ``docme``.
| Simply create an instance of :class:`DocWriter<docme.builders.writer.DocWriter>` and call ``generate`` function.
